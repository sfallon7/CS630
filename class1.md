### 4 main parts of a computer
	
- cpu, ram, buss
- registers are the smallest pieces of memory because they are closest to cpu
- cache
- main memory
- storage
- computations are  passed along from storage down the line to registers

### IO DATA
- System Buss - provides communication amiong preoceessors, main memory and IO modules

### Processors consist of 3 parts
- arithmatetic logic unit
- controller unit
- registers

### CPU contains the following registers
- program counter (PC)- stores the address of the instruction
- Memory Address Register (MAR) - specifies the address in memory for the next read writer values
- Memory Buffer Register MBR - contains the data to be written or read from data
- IO Address Register - specifies address of device
- IO buffer address register IO BR exchanges address of device
